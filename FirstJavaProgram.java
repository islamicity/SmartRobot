// public: This makes the main method public that means that we can call the method from outside the class.
// static: We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run itself.
// void: It does not return anything.
// main: It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.
// (String[] args): Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings. We will cover that in a separate post.
